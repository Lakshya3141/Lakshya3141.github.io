Hello! I'm Lakshya Chauhan, an incoming master's student at the University of Groningen (RUG) for my first semester in the Erasmus Mundus Masters in Evolutionary Biology (MEME) program. While my interests in science are all over the place, I am getting increasingly interested in evolutionary theory and the evolution of various complex social behaviors recently. I wish to work on these topics with the help of rigorous mathematical frameworks and perhaps confirmation and correction from empirical evidence.

I obtained my bachelor's in science from the Indian Institute of Science as a Biology major. Here, I worked across many fields in my quest to find a stable state field that I may pursue in my higher studies. To say that I have found such a field would be a lie, as I am still exploring, my latest infatuation being ecology and evolution. <a href="https://be.iisc.ac.in/~mkjolly/">Dr. Mohit Kumar Jolly</a> was my (stupendous) supervisor throughout the second half of my bachelor's. An extensive list of my attempts at science can be found over at my <a href="https://lakshya3141.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> page.

Now to the fun stuff! While the initial drive to create this website was purely professional, that's not all this is. Much more recently, I have been reading up popular science, listening to podcasts, looking up cool experiments and thinking of starting a blog. Thus came the need for this website, which shall now serve a professional need, a personal need, and a vent for my unfiltered thoughts and occasional obsessions. I plan on documenting my journey through science as it progresses, as well as writing personal opinions about various aspects of academia which are definitely subject to change as I gain experience and exposure. A selection of my favorite literature, sci-fi movies, and pop-sci books can be found on the <a href="https://lakshya3141.github.io/blog/">Fun Stuff</a> page. My unfiltered thoughts, experiences and challenges about academia can be found on the <a href="https://lakshya3141.github.io/blog/">Blogs</a> page.
