Hello! I'm Lakshya Chauhan, an incoming master's student at the University of Groningen (RUG) for my first semester in the Erasmus Mundus Masters in Evolutionary Biology (MEME) program. While my interests in science are all over the place, I am getting increasingly interested in Evolutionary theory and the Evolution of various complex social behaviors recently. I wish to work on these topics with the help of rigorous mathematical frameworks and perhaps confirmation and correction from empirical evidence.

I obtained my bachelor's in science from the Indian Institute of Science as a Biology major. Here, I worked across many fields in my quest to find a stable state field that I may pursue in my higher studies. To say that I have found such a field would be a lie, as I am still exploring, my latest infatuation being ecology and evolution. My bachelor's thesis was divided into two parts, one revolving around using CRISPRa to construct synthetic genetic circuits with <a href="">Prof. Yolanda Schaerli</a> at University of Lausanne. The other aspect of my thesis focused on liver metastasis and subtyping in Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) using single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and this project is a collaboration with <a href="">Dr. Anish Thomas</a> at National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, USA. <a href="">Dr. Mohit Kumar Jolly</a> was my (stupendous) supervisor throughout the second half of my bachelor's. A more extensive list of my attempts at science can be found over at <a href="">Projects</a> page.
